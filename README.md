**ONE SIMPLE TRICK TO GET TABLOID HELPER FUNCTIONS**

[Tabloid, AKA The Clickbait Headline Programming Language](https://github.com/thesephist/tabloid), is a new esoteric programming language for creating attention-grabbing code.

I thought it would be fun to try to make some helper functions using the minimal operators available (`+`, `-`, `ร`, `รท`, `%`, `>`, `<`, `===`).
Everything is recursive, there's no list/array/memory that I know of.  The only control flow operators are if/else and return.

 - [Maths functions](./maths) - things like exponentials, rounding.  I'm hoping to create some more robust logarithm/root/trigonometric functions too.
 - [Boolean](./boolean) - Your favourite boolean operators - AND, OR, NOT, XOR.  You can chain together for NOR/NAND.
 - [Bitwise](./bitwise) - Some bitwise operators (only left and right shift at the moment)
